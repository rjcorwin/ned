7.x-1.0-rc1 => 7.x-1.0-rc2

  Added local storage caching for entities. Intelligently adds/removes based on
  C.R.U.D. operation.

  The hook_services_request_postprocess_alter() function has been renamed to
  hook_services_request_pre_postprocess_alter(), and the
  hook_services_request_postprocess_alter() function has been re added AFTER
  the service resources success function has been called. Rename any of your
  implementations of hook_services_request_postprocess_alter() to
  hook_services_request_pre_postprocess_alter().
